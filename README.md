# House-Price-Prediction

In this project, we aim to use machine learning and statistical modeling to estimate the sale price of residential houses based on a range of home features from Ames, Iowa. This dataset includes detailed information on 79 different variables for houses sold between 2006 and 2010. The question we pursue is what model was best at predicting SalesPrice and understanding which factors have the greatest impact on house prices. Since we have many features, we will try a variety of feature selection methods and train models using ensemble methods, including RandomForest, Bagging, and XGboost.
